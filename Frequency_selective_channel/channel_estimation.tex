\section{System Model}	


Consider a $N_r \times N_t$ channel matrix between transmitter and receiver that
is frequency selective with $N_c$ delay taps. Each tap is denoted as $\bfH_d$,
$d=\{0,1, \ldots, N_c-1\}$. The variable $\rho$ denotes the average received power and $\bfz_n \sim $
$\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma ^2\bfI)$ the circularly symmetric complex Gaussian
distributed noise vector, therefore, the received signal is expressed as

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:rx_signal}
   \bfr_{l,n} = \sqrt{\rho} \sum_{d=0}^{N_c-1} \bfH_d\bff_{l}s_{n-d} + \bfz_{l,n},
\end{equation}
where $s_{n}$ is the $n$th non-zero of the training frame of length $N + N_c-1$
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:frame}
  \bfs = [0, \ldots, 0,  s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_N ].
\end{equation}
At the receiver, and a $\textrm{RF}$  combiner $\bfw_k$ is applied over the
training frame, so that the combiner output is expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:output_combiner}
   y_{k,l,n} = \sqrt{\rho}\bfw^H_k \sum_{d=0}^{N_c-1} \bfH_d\bff_{l}s_{n-d} + z_{k,l,n},
 \end{equation}
 where $z_{k,l,n} = w^H_k\bfz_{l,n}$
The output signal can described in term of tensor notation

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:output_combiner_tensor}
  y_{k,l,n} =  \calH \times_1 \bfw^H_k \times_2 \bff_{l} \times \bfs_n,
\end{equation}
where $\calH$ is generated from the concatenation in the third dimension of the $N_c$ delay taps.
Assuming a collection  of transmitter and receiver beams, i.e.
$l=\{1,\ldots , L \}$ and $k=\{1,\ldots , K \}$, respectively, and the $N$ time
instants within the training frame, we can express the signal model as the
third-order tensor

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:tensor_model}
  \calY =  \calH \times_1 \bfW \times_2 \bfF \times_3 \bfS + \calZ \times_1 W,
\end{equation}
where $\bfS$ is toeplitz because there is a convolution operation over the third dimension.
