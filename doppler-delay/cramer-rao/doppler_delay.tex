\section{Cramer-Rao bound}	
	Let us consider a single antenna transmitter and receiver that communicates through a channel that is composed by a single tap. The transmitted signal is defined as $s(t)$ and the received signal is $r(t)$. Assuming the receiver samples the received signal $r(t)$, the system model is written as
	\begin{equation}
		r(nT_s) = \beta s(nT_s - \tau)\textrm{e}^{-2\pi \jmath f_DT_s n} + z(nT_s),
	\end{equation}
where $\beta$ is the propagation loss, $f_D$ is the doppler deviation, $\tau$ is the delay, and $T_s$ is the sampling period. The pdf of the received signal is give by

\begin{equation}
  g(f_D,\tau) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\sigma ^2}}\textrm{e}^{\prod_{n=1}^{N}\frac{\left(r(nT_s) - \beta s(nT_s - \tau)\textrm{e}^{-2\pi \jmath f_DT_s n}\right)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
\end{equation}



\begin{align}
 \frac{\partial \textrm{ln}\{g(f_D,\tau)\} }{\partial  f_D} & = \frac{\partial }{\partial  f_D} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{\left(r(nT_s) - \beta s(nT_s - \tau)\textrm{e}^{-2\pi \jmath f_DT_s n}\right)^2}{2\sigma^2} \\
 & = \sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{\left(r(nT_s) - \beta s(nT_s - \tau)\textrm{e}^{-2\pi \jmath f_DT_s n}\right)}{\sigma^2} \jmath 2\pi \beta T_s n s(nT_s - \tau)\textrm{e}^{-\jmath 2\pi f_DT_s n} \\
  & = \sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{\left(r(nT_s) - \beta s(nT_s - \tau)\textrm{e}^{-\jmath 2\pi f_DT_s n}\right)}{\sigma^2} 2\pi \beta T_s n s(nT_s - \tau)\textrm{e}^{-\jmath 2\pi f_DT_s n + \pi/2} \\
\end{align}
   
itemize     

%The Doppler effect ant the $\tau$ are important sources of errors in wireless communication systems, causing losses of performance at receiver. Therefore, the Doppler effect and the delay estimations are important problems that must considered before the data detection in order to achieve a reliable communication.
