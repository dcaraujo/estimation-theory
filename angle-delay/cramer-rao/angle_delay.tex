Consider the geometric channel for the frequency selective massive \gls{mimo}
composed by a set of $L$ scattering clusters. The $n$th delay tap of the $u$th
\gls{UE} is expressed as 
\begin{align}
  H_{u}[n] = \sum^{L}_{l=1} \beta _l p(nT_s - \tau _l) \bfa _{\textrm{R} }(\phi_{\textrm{R},l},\theta_{\textrm{R},l})\bfa _{\textrm{T}}(\phi_{\textrm{T},}\theta _{\textrm{T} , l}),
\end{align}
where  $p(t)$ defines the signal pulse shaping at $t$, $T_s$ is the symbol
period, $\alpha _l $ $\in$ $\mathcal{C}$ is the complex gain of the $l$th
cluster, $\tau _l$ $\in$ $\mathcal{R}$  is the delay associated to the $l$th
cluster, and  $\bfa _{\textrm{R} }(\phi_{\textrm{R},l},\theta_{\textrm{R},l}$
$\in$ $\mathcal{C}^{N \times 1}$ and $\bfa
_{\textrm{T}}(\phi_{\textrm{T},}\theta _{\textrm{T} , l})$ $\in$ $\mathcal{C}
^{M \times 1}$ is the antenna array response vector of the
receiver and transmitter sides.

Considering the 

%The Doppler effect ant the $\tau$ are important sources of errors in wireless communication systems, causing losses of performance at receiver. Therefore, the Doppler effect and the delay estimations are important problems that must considered before the data detection in order to achieve a reliable communication.
